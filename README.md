# Real-Time-Flight-Tracking-Pipeline
This project simulates a **real-time flight tracking system** (similar to AirRadar 2024) using a modern data engineering pipeline.   It generates fake flight events, streams them through Kafka, processes with Spark, stores in PostgreSQL, and visualizes with Streamlit.
